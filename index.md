notification: During the initial phase of implementation, the Family Justice
  Courts will refer repeat maintenance enforcement applications to the MEOs so
  that those who have had to apply repeatedly to enforce maintenance orders can
  benefit from the new MEP first. All maintenance enforcement applications will
  be referred to MEOs in the next phase of implementation.
