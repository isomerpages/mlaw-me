<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Division is a division&nbsp;of the Insolvency
and Public Trusteeâ€™s Office. It is staffed by Maintenance Enforcement Officers
(MEOs) who will discharge their functions and duties under the Maintenance
Enforcement Process (MEP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MEP was introduced under the Family Justice Reform Bill in May 2023,
to improve the enforcement of maintenance orders by:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) deterring non-payment of maintenance;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b) making enforcement easier when there is non-payment of maintenance;</p>
<p></p>
<p>c) promoting sustainable maintenance outcomes; and&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>d) increasing access to justice for applicants, especially those who are
self-represented.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The key functions of the MEOs include:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fact-finding on financial circumstances:</strong> MEOs
are empowered to conduct fact-finding into the financial circumstances
of the parties involved. They do so by obtaining information from parties
and, if necessary, from third parties such as banks and government agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Referral to financial assistance</strong>:
MEOs will identify suitable parties and refer them to relevant financial
assistance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Conciliation sessions</strong>: MEOs
will conduct conciliation sessions. During these sessions, MEOs will facilitate
settlement between parties, with a view to promoting amicable and practical
resolution of the maintenance enforcement application. Click here for more
information about conciliation sessions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Submission of information to the court</strong>:
MEOs will provide the information gathered to the court. This will enable
the court to make more targeted and effective enforcement orders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEOs only deal with maintenance enforcement applications referred
by the Family Justice Courts (FJC). Maintenance enforcement applications
can only be made to the FJC.</p>
