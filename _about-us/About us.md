<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Division, which is established within the
Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office, is staffed by Maintenance Enforcement
Officers (“<strong>MEOs</strong>”) who will discharge their functions and
duties under the new Maintenance Enforcement Process ("<strong>MEP</strong>").&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEP was introduced under the Family Justice Reform Bill in May 2023,
to improve the enforcement of maintenance orders and ensure that the process
of obtaining maintenance is easier.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEP seeks to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) strengthen deterrence against non-payment of maintenance;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) make the enforcement process easier when maintenance is not paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the new MEP, the Ministry of Law established the Maintenance
Enforcement Division within the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office
which will be staffed by Maintenance Enforcement Officers (“MEOs”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The key functions of the MEOs include: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) <strong>Fact-finding on Financial Circumstances</strong>: MEOs are empowered
to conduct fact-finding into the financial circumstances of the parties
involved by obtaining information from parties and third parties such as
banks and government agencies, if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b) <strong>Referral to Financial Assistance</strong>: MEOs will identify
suitable and needy parties and refer them to relevant financial assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>c) <strong>Conciliation Sessions</strong>: MEOs will conduct conciliation
sessions and facilitate settlement between parties, with a view to promote
amicable and practical solutions to maintenance enforcement applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>d) <strong>Submission of Information to the Court</strong>: MEOs will provide
the information gathered to the court which will enable the court to make
more targeted and effective enforcement orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the initial phase of implementation, the Family Justice Courts
will refer repeat maintenance enforcement applications to the MEOs so that
those who have had to apply repeatedly to enforce maintenance orders can
benefit from the new MEP first. All maintenance enforcement applications
will be referred to MEOs in the next phase of implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
