<h4>Phased approach</h4>
<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) will be implemented in two phases.
In Phase 1, only certain maintenance enforcement applications, in respect
of certain kinds of maintenance orders, will be referred to the Maintenance
Enforcement Officers (MEOs). This referral is done by the Family Justice
Courts after the applicant files a maintenance enforcement application
there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Phase 2, all maintenance enforcement applications in respect of all
maintenance orders will be referred to the MEOs.</p>
