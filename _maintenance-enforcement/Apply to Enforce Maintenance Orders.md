<h3>What maintenance orders does the Maintenance Enforcement Process ("MEP") apply to?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>During the initial phase of implementation, the Family Justice Courts
will refer repeat maintenance enforcement applications to the Maintenance
Enforcement Officers ("MEO") so that those who have had to apply repeatedly
to enforce maintenance orders can benefit from the new MEP first. All maintenance
enforcement applications will be referred to MEOs in the next phase of
implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEP does not apply to enforcement of maintenance orders under the
Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1975 which are:</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Maintenance orders made in Singapore to be enforced in a reciprocating
country; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintenance orders made in reciprocating countries to be enforced in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ol>
