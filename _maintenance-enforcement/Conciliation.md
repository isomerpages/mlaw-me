<p>The court may direct the Applicant and Respondent to attend before an
MEO for a conciliation session. Both parties must attend the conciliation
session. In a conciliation session, the MEO is a neutral facilitator guiding
the conversations between parties. The MEO will recommend solutions to
facilitate a mutually acceptable and sustainable resolution to the maintenance
dispute. The MEO will not make decisions for the parties, and parties may
accept or reject suggestions or proposals made by the MEO. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If an agreement is reached, the MEO will submit a report of the agreement
to the Court. A Consent Order will then be issued in the presence of the
parties by the Court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there is no agreement, the MEO may request for further information
from both parties and/or from third parties before conducting a second
conciliation, if necessary. A report containing this information will be
submitted to the Court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there is no agreement after the second conciliation session, the parties
will appear before the Court for the hearing of the application. The Court
may rely on the MEO report in coming to a decision.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Tips for a successful conciliation session</h4>
<p></p>
<p>A negotiated settlement often proves more advantageous than a litigated
outcome. Parties can shape the agreement themselves, rather than leaving
the final decision to the Court, which may potentially leave both sides
dissatisfied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To this end, parties should approach the conciliation session with an
open mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important for parties to be willing to listen to each otherâ€™s perspectives,
communicate respectfully, and be open to finding a mutually acceptable
solution. They should also be prepared to compromise and prioritise the
well-being of any children involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doing so will enhance the chances of parties reaching agreement. For example,
if the Respondent has genuine difficulties paying maintenance, parties
can discuss and agree on more sustainable maintenance payments during the
conciliation session.</p>
