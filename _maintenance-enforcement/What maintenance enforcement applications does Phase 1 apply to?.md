<p>Phase 1 will take effect on 16 January 2025, and will apply to eligible
repeat cases. An eligible repeat maintenance enforcement application is
an application to enforce a maintenance order (made under the Womenâ€™s Charter
1961, the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934, the Administration of Muslim
Law Act 1966, and the Maintenance of Parents Act 1995) in respect of which:
<br>
<br>(a) there is at least one concluded maintenance enforcement application
(i.e. the application and any appeal have been disposed of, and/or the
time for appeal has lapsed); and
<br>
<br>(b) there is no pending maintenance enforcement application.
<br>
<br>The MEP will be expanded to apply to more categories of maintenance enforcement
applications in later phases.</p>
