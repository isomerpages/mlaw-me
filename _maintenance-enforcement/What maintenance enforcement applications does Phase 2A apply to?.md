<p>Phase 2A will take effect on 1 October 2025, and will include first-time
maintenance enforcement applications, applied on or after 1 October 2025,
where the maintenance arrears under the maintenance order are $10,000.00
or more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Repeat maintenance enforcement applications will continue to be referred
to the Maintenance Enforcement Officer. An eligible repeat maintenance
enforcement application is an application to enforce a maintenance order
(made under the Womenâ€™s Charter 1961, the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934,
the Administration of Muslim Law Act 1966, and the Maintenance of Parents
Act 1995) in respect of which:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) there is at least one concluded maintenance enforcement application
(i.e. the application and any appeal have been disposed of, and/or the
time for appeal has lapsed); and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) there is no pending maintenance enforcement application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEP will be expanded to cover more categories of maintenance enforcement
applications in a later phase.</p>
