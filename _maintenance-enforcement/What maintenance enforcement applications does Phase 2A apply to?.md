<p><strong>Phase 2A starts on 1 October 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Phase 2A will apply to two types of maintenance enforcement cases where
unpaid maintenance amounts to $10,000 or more:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat cases</strong>
</p>
<p>These are cases where:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Applicant have previously applied to enforce the same maintenance
order, and that previous application has been completed (including any
appeals)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Applicant do not currently have another enforcement application pending
for the same order</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First-time cases with high arrears</strong>
</p>
<p>These are cases where:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Applicant have never applied to enforce this particular maintenance
order before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Applicant do not currently have any enforcement application pending
for this order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any appeals against the original maintenance order have been completed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What maintenance orders are covered?</strong>
</p>
<p>Maintenance orders made under:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Women's Charter 1961</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guardianship of Infants Act 1934</p>
</li>
