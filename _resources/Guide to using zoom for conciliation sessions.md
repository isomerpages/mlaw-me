<h4><strong>GUIDE TO USING ZOOM FOR CONCILIATION SESSIONS</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Getting started with Zoom</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A video conference conciliation
session conducted on the Zoom platform is a Zoom meeting. You can download
Zoom at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://zoom.us/</a>.
The software is free and can be installed on your mobile phone, iPad, desktops,
laptops and notebook computers and from Google Play Store (for Android
devices) or from App Store (for iOS devices). For further information on
downloading Zoom, please go to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not need to pay to use Zoom
to attend a conciliation session. You also do not need to create any Zoom
account (whether free or paid) to use Zoom to attend a conciliation session
although you may do so if you wish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoom can be used on a suitable
mobile device with a front-facing camera, e.g. a tablet or mobile phone.
Similarly, you can use a desktop or notebook computer with a front-facing
camera.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Joining a Zoom conciliation session</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the appointed conciliation
session, log into the Zoom “Waiting Room”. You can do this using one of
these methods (depending on the device you are using, the interface may
appear slightly differently):</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the <strong>Meeting ID </strong>and<strong> the passcode </strong>assigned
for your conciliation session (this can be found in the “Notice of Conciliation
Session” sent by the MEO).</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your display name, please state
in the following order: (1) the case number; (2) your first and last name.
For example, “MSS 123/2020 Nicole Lim”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please connect audio and video
and click Join. Do not select “Do not connect to audio”. Do not select
“Turn off my video”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If prompted, click “Join Audio
by Computer” to connect your computer’s speakers and microphone to the
Zoom Meeting. You should also click on “Join with Video” if prompted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have joined the Zoom Meeting,
you will be kept in a Waiting Room. You will see the message, “Please wait,
the meeting host will let you in soon”.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Conduct during the video conference conciliation session</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must dress appropriately as
if you are attending an in-person conciliation session.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that you are in a quiet
location alone and are not driving.&nbsp; Only parties themselves will
be admitted into the Zoom conciliation session. Please ensure that there
are no other parties present in the same room during the conciliation session.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be asked to produce your
photo identity card to verify your identity before the start of the conciliation
session.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorised audio or visual recording
of conciliation session is strictly prohibited. The recording function
in the Zoom application will be disallowed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Encountering problems during the Zoom conciliation session</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are unexpectedly disconnected
from the conciliation session, please try to rejoin the hearing as soon
possible using the same Zoom ID and password details. Please consider using
a wired Internet connection or moving to a location with a better WiFi
signal to improve the strength of your connection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>16.&nbsp; If you are unable to rejoin the conciliation session after 5
minutes or more, please contact the Maintenance Enforcement Division as
soon as possible at 1800 2255 529.</p>
