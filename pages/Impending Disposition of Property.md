<p><strong>Impending Disposition of Property</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q1. What is a disposition of property? What does an impending notable disposition of property in the MEO’s interim report mean?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A disposition of property involves transferring ownership or control over
a property to another person. It may involve a sale, gift, expenditure,
or any other transfer of property rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MEO’s interim report has identified that the Respondent may be intending
to dispose a property that he or she currently owns or control.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q2. What can you do to prevent the Respondent’s impending disposition of property?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can apply to the Family Justice Courts (“FJC”) for a court order to
prohibit the Respondent from disposing his or her property until the maintenance
enforcement application has been decided. This is called an injunction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The injunction application is made under section 139M(1)(b) of the Women’s
Charter.</p>
<p></p>

<p>(1) <strong>Filing an injunction application without notifying the Respondent</strong> -
You can file for an injunction application without needing to inform the
Respondent about the application. This is so that the Respondent will not
attempt to dispose of the property before the injunction can be made. The
Court will hear your application without the Respondent present.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can file the without notice injunction application through FJC’s Integrated
Family Application Management System (“iFAMS”) at <a href="https://ifams/judiciary.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://ifams/judiciary.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS</a> using
your Singpass, under “Maintenance Order Application &gt; Application for
variation or enforcement of existing maintenance order &gt; Injunction”.</p>
<p>You must:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) Fill up the application form on iFAMS.</p>
<p>(b) Upload an Affidavit, which should include:</p>
<p>(i) The MEO’s interim report;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(ii) An explanation on the urgency of the injunction application and why
the Respondent should not be informed about the injunction application;
and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(iii) The merits of the injunction application.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>You have a duty to disclose all material facts you know or reasonably
ought to know, including anything that may negatively impact your case.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It costs $x to file an injunction application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) <strong>If the Court decides the injunction application is not such an urgent one or the Respondent should be informed of the application</strong><sup>3</sup> -
Despite you filing for a without notice injunction application, the Court
may decide that your application is not so urgent or the Respondent should
be informed. FJC will notify the Respondent of your injunction application,
and give directions for the Respondent to file a reply Affidavit. The Respondent
can file his or her reply Affidavit through FJC’s iFAMS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) <strong>If the Court decides the injunction application is urgent, and grants an interim injunction</strong> –
On the other hand, if the Court decides that the injunction application
is urgent, it may hear the application in the Respondent’s absence, and
grant an interim (i.e. temporary) injunction. This will prohibit the Respondent
from disposing his or her property until the interim injunction is set
aside (“reversed”) or FJC decides on the maintenance enforcement application,
whichever is later. <strong>You</strong> will have to agree to compensate
the Respondent for losses incurred(see Q6 below).</p>
<p></p>
<p>FJC will serve your injunction application and the interim injunction
on the Respondent. It will also give directions to the Respondent to file
a [reply Affidavit / application to set aside the injunction] (if necessary).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(4) <strong>Respondent files reply Affidavit / application to set aside the injunction</strong> –
If the Respondent wishes to challenge the injunction, the Respondent can
file a [reply affidavit / application to set aside the injunction order
(without supporting Affidavit)] on FJC’s iFAMs. FJC will serve the reply
Affidavit / setting aside application on <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) <strong>Injunction hearing with both parties</strong> – After (2) and
(4), the Court will fix <strong>a date</strong> to hear both parties, and
decide whether to grant an injunction, make the interim injunction order
final or set aside the interim injunction (if one was already made under
step (3)).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(6) <strong>Injunction granted</strong> – If an injunction is granted, the
Respondent will be prohibited from disposing of his or her property until
FJC decides on the maintenance enforcement application. You will have to
agree to compensate the Respondent for losses incurred (see Q6 below).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q4. Is there a deadline for you to file the injunction application?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no deadline to file an injunction application. However, the MEO’s
interim report will be made available to the Respondent 14 days after it
is made available to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q5. Is there a deadline for you to apply for legal aid from the Legal Aid Bureau to assist with the filing of the injunction application?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no deadline to apply for legal aid from the Legal Aid Bureau.
However, if you wish to obtain legal aid to file the injunction application
before the interim report is released to the Respondent, you are highly
encouraged to approach the Legal Aid Bureau at least 5 working days before
the end of the 14-day timeline (for the release of the report to the Respondent).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q6. What is an agreement to compensate the Respondent for losses incurred ?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If an injunction or an interim injunction is to be granted, you will be
required by the Court to agree to compensate the Respondent for losses
that he or she may incur, if it is subsequently decided [at the maintenance
enforcement hearing] that the injunction or interim injunction ought not
to have been granted. This is also known as an undertaking as to damages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You will be required to agree that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“If the Court later finds that this [injunction] order has caused loss
to the Respondent, and decides that the Respondent should be compensated
for that loss, the Applicant will comply with any order the Court may make.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q7. When may the Court find that you should compensate the Respondent for loss?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Court may find that you should compensate the Respondent for loss
suffered as a result of the injunction, where it is subsequently decided
that the injunction should not have been granted. This may happen where,
for example:</p>
<p>• You are unable to prove that the Respondent was in breach of the maintenance
order.</p>
<p>• You did not make full and frank disclosure of material facts, which
led to the injunction being granted.</p>
<p>• You abused the injunction process for an improper purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q8. What happens if you are not successful in the application for an injunction, e.g. you fail to obtain an injunction, or the court decides to reverse the interim injunction?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may be ordered to pay the Respondent compensation for losses such
as: financial losses, loss of business opportunities, or other losses which
the Respondent can prove, as well as the Respondent’s legal costs, if he
or she is represented.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q9. Does the identification of the potential impending notable disposition of property in the MEO’s interim report guarantee that the Court will grant an injunction?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>No. The MEO’s interim report shows that the Respondent may be about to
dispose of property. It is for the Court to decide if there is a real risk
of the property being disposed of. The Respondent may also prove that he
or she does not intend to dispose of the property to reduce his or her
means to pay maintenance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q10. What would the injunction order look like?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>An injunction order can prohibit the disposal of property either in Singapore,
or worldwide. These can be found at Forms X and X in the Family Justice
Practice Directions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q11. What can you do if the Respondent disposed of the property before you applied for the</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>injunction?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the Respondent disposes of the property before you apply for an injunction,
you can apply</p>
<p>to set aside the disposition (“setting aside application”). This application
is made under</p>
<p>section 139M(1)(a) of the Women’s Charter, and if granted, will “undo”
the disposition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can file a setting aside application through FJC’s iFAMS at <a href="https://ifams/judiciary.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://ifams/judiciary.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS</a> using
your Singpass, under “Maintenance Order Application &gt; Application for
variation or enforcement of existing maintenance order &gt; Injunction”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) Fill up the application form on iFAMS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) Upload an Affidavit , which should include the MEO’s interim report.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It costs $x to file a setting aside application.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q12. What happens to the maintenance enforcement application after you receive the MEO’s interim report?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the MEO’s interim report is made available to you, the maintenance
enforcement proceedings will be paused until the report is made available
to the Respondent 14 days later. If you do not apply for an injunction
application or a setting aside application by the end of the 14 days, the
maintenance enforcement proceedings will resume.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you apply for an injunction application or a setting aside application,
the maintenance enforcement proceedings will resume only after the injunction
or setting aside proceedings have concluded.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q13. Who can you approach for legal assistance?</strong>
