<p>To improve the enforcement of maintenance orders and ensure that the process
of obtaining maintenance is easier, the new Maintenance Enforcement Process
(MEP) was introduced under the Family Justice Reform Act in May 2023. The
MEP seeks to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)strengthen deterrence against non-payment of maintenance;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>make the enforcement process easier when maintenance is not paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the new MEP, the Ministry of Law established the Maintenance
Enforcement Division within the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office
which will be staffed by Maintenance Enforcement Officers (“MEOs”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key functions of the MEOs include: &nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact-finding on Financial Circumstances: MEOs are empowered to conduct
fact-finding into the financial circumstances of the parties involved by
obtaining information from parties and third party agencies like banks
and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Referral to Financial Assistance: MEOs will identify suitable and needy
parties and refer them to relevant financial assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conciliation Sessions: MEOs will conduct conciliation sessions and facilitate
settlement between parties thus promoting amicable and practical solutions
to maintenance enforcement applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submission of Information to the Court: MEOs will provide the necessary
information to the court which will enable the court to make more targeted
and effective enforcement orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the initial phase of implementation, the Family Justice Courts
will refer repeat maintenance enforcement applications to the MEOs so that
those who had to apply repeatedly to enforce maintenance orders can benefit
from the new MEP first. All maintenance enforcement applications will be
referred to MEOs in the next phase of implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
