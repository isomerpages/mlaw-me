<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Officer (MEO) plays a crucial role in ensuring
the financial well-being of individuals involved in maintenance enforcement
matters. The key functions of the MEO include:
<br>
<br>(a) Investigating the financial circumstances of the parties involved.
<br>
<br>(b) Referring eligible individuals to financial assistance and other support
services.
<br>
<br>(c) Facilitating conciliation and settlements between the parties.
<br>
<br>(d) Compiling and submitting relevant information gathered during fact-finding
and conciliation sessions to the Court.</p>
<p>Operating as a department within the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office
under the Ministry of Law, MEOs are appointed by the Law Minister, and
their responsibilities are outlined in the Family Justice Reform Act 2023.</p>
<p>During the initial phase of implementation, the Family Justice Courts
will direct repeat maintenance enforcement applications to the MEOs, ensuring
a more streamlined and effective process for all parties involved.</p>
