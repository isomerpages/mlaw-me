<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will happen if the Respondent does not show up?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If Applicant or Respondent does not turn up 30 minutes into the scheduled
first conciliation session, the Maintenance Enforcement Officers will record
the parties’ attendance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Officer then reschedules the conciliation
session for both parties to one week’s time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If Respondent is absent again without providing any notice or reasons,
the Maintenance Enforcement Officer will inform the Family Justice Courts
to seek the Court’s directions. The Family Justice Courts may direct the
parties to attend a conciliation session on a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the Respondent remains absent for the conciliation session, the Maintenance
Enforcement Officer will proceed to obtain information from various third-party
agencies if the Respondent did not submit any documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will happen if the Respondent refuses to submit documents to the Maintenance Enforcement Officer?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the Respondent refuses to submit documents to the Maintenance Enforcement
Officer as directed by the Family Justice Courts, he/she will be in contempt
of court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Officer will obtain the required information
from third party agencies if the Respondent refuses to submit any documents.
Thereafter, the Maintenance Enforcement Officer will prepare a report with
the information obtained from the third party agencies, and submit it to
the court.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will happen if the Respondent says that he wants to vary the court order during the conciliation session?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maintenance arrears between the date of the previous order(s) and the
present remain payable in full.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A variation of maintenance order for <em>future</em> maintenance payments
can be discussed during the conciliation session with the Maintenance Enforcement
Officer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need a lawyer in the maintenance enforcement process?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A lawyer is not necessary to apply for the enforcement of maintenance
order. However, parties are at liberty to obtain legal advice from a practising
lawyer if parties deem it necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long will it take for the MEO to conduct fact-finding and conciliation?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first conciliation session will be scheduled by the court in about
three weeks from the date of the Summons issued by the court. Each conciliation
session is estimated to be in the duration of between one and one and a
half hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If parties do not reach a settlement at the first conciliation session,
the Maintenance Enforcement Officers will conduct fact-finding with third-party
agencies which may take up to a further three to four weeks. A second conciliation
session, if necessary, will only be fixed after the Maintenance Enforcement
Officer completes the necessary fact-finding with the third-party agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the conciliation session conducted?</strong>
