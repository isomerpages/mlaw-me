<h4>Phased approach</h4>
<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) will be implemented in two phases[SY1]&nbsp;.
In Phase 1, only certain maintenance enforcement applications, in respect
of certain kinds of maintenance orders, will be referred to the Maintenance
Enforcement Officers (MEOs). This referral is done by the Family Justice
Courts after the applicant files a maintenance enforcement application
there.</p>
<p>In Phase 2, all maintenance enforcement applications in respect of all
maintenance orders will be referred to the MEOs.</p>
<p>A maintenance order refers to an order for the provision of support (financial
in nature) for wives, children, incapacitated husbands or parents. &nbsp;A
maintenance enforcement application refers to an application to enforce
an existing maintenance order if the respondent does not comply with it.
